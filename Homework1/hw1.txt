1. By using List.for_all, a higher order function that recursively goes through a list I was able
to ensure that the code written for the first function subset a b did not have any "side effects"

2.  Since calls of other functions and duplicates are allowed I just checked if sets a and b were subsets of each other.

3. Given that we are allowed to include duplicates I just used the @ operator as discussed in discussion 2 to append list b to list a.

4. To create the union of all of the members of the set a I just used List.fold_left that recursively
adds to an accumulator as it goes over a list and I used set union as the function which pretty much just appends all items of 
the list of lists to each other as described by the above function. 

5. An explanation can be found in a comment in the hw1test.ml file that explains more in depth. But the answer
ends up being that no it is not possible to write such a function in OCaml.

6. This function just recursively calls f(x) and checks if it is equal to x by the eq. It was only challenging figuring out 
how to implement recursion in Ocaml.

7. I created a helper funciton do_p_times that nested the function p times. I checked fixed point with the equality predicate eq and then 
return x if true and otherwise recursively call the function but replacing x with (f x). Both functions were built recursively. 

8. I used recursion creating the base cases in which the condition was met by s or s(x) returning [] and [x] respectively. Else I 
returned the list x appended by the recursive call to the function whiles_eq

9. As advised I created a variety of helper functions instead of nesting. I also created types for the term and non_term. My functions effectively 
find blind alleys by finding cyclic non_terms that cannot create terminals. Then it grows the creating set. Next it finds the fixed point of the 
creating set. Finally I filter out the blind_alleys after following the above processes.

Usage Impacts:

- Overall ChatGPT helped me accelerate my learning through helping me learn concepts faster and confirm hunches. At points 
where I felt lost on the assignment it also helped point me in the right direction. I tried to keep usage to mostly exploratory
questions without delving to deep into specific code slices, but the responses unavoidably contained specific code at times. 
The only time I copied specific code was to better understand the given test cases for blind alleys as I found these problems particularly
challenging. On the negative side the tool can lead to confirmation bias by attempting to confirm what the user is saying rather
than staying truthful. This is a natural product of the pattern and sentiment matching of LLM's and occurs to a degree with search enginess, but 
helps serve as a reminder of how the tool can be abused to create false perceptions. This confirms that relying on expert understanding with the full
context of problems is important as GenAI is a powerful tool, but ultimately not all knowing. 

How does the List.for_all operator work and does it avoid side effects.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
The core idea of List.for_all is simple: given a predicate p : ’a -> bool and a list l : ’a list, it returns

true if for every element x in l, p x evaluates to true,
false as soon as it finds an x with p x = false.
Here’s roughly how it’s implemented in the standard library:

let rec for_all p = function
  | []      -> true
  | x :: xs -> 
      if p x then
        for_all p xs
      else
        false
Or more succinctly, using OCaml’s short‑circuiting &&:

let rec for_all p = function
  | []      -> true
  | x :: xs -> p x && for_all p xs
Short‑circuiting
As soon as p x is false, it stops recursing and returns false—it does not visit the rest of the list.
Empty list
By convention, for_all p [] = true.
Side‐effects
List.for_all itself is purely functional: it does not mutate the list or carry hidden state.
However, if your predicate p performs side‑effects (e.g. printing, modifying a ref, I/O), those will still happen each time p x is called.
In other words, List.for_all guarantees no extra side‑effects beyond whatever your predicate does.
Complexity
Worst‑case it examines every element once, so it’s O(n). In the best case (first element fails) it’s O(1).
Example usage:

# List.for_all (fun x -> x > 0) [1; 2; 3; 4];;
- : bool = true

# List.for_all (fun x -> x mod 2 = 0) [2; 4; 3; 6];;
- : bool = false  (* stops as soon as it sees 3 *)
So: yes, List.for_all itself avoids side‑effects and mutations—but it will faithfully execute whatever effects your predicate carries out.

You said:
Does @ operator just append lists and include duplicates in Ocaml. Is it proper to use it or the :: operator when appending to lists
ChatGPT said:
In OCaml the two operators serve very different purposes:

@ (append / concatenation)
let (@) : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
  = List.append
What it does:
l1 @ l2 returns a brand‑new list whose elements are all of l1 (in order) followed by all of l2 (in order).
Duplicates:
It makes no effort to remove or merge duplicates—you get exactly the elements you started with, in sequence.
Performance:
Runs in O(length of l1) time and allocates a new spine for those nodes; l2 is shared (its nodes aren’t copied).
:: (cons)
let (::) : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list
  = fun x xs -> (* a new list node with head x, tail xs *) 
What it does:
Prepends a single element onto the front of an existing list.
Usage:
Use when you want to build up a list one element at a time (e.g. x :: acc). This is O(1).
Which to use when appending?
Adding one element: always x :: xs.
let xs = [2;3;4] in
let ys = 1 :: xs    (* == [1;2;3;4] *)
Merging two lists: use l1 @ l2, but only when you have two complete lists.
let evens = [2;4;6] in
let odds  = [1;3;5] in
evens @ odds        (* == [2;4;6;1;3;5] *)
Avoid repeated single‐element appends: writing
let rec build n acc =
  if n = 0 then acc
  else build (n-1) (acc @ [n])
is O(n²) and should be rewritten as

let rec build n acc =
  if n = 0 then acc
  else build (n-1) (n :: acc)
in
List.rev (build 100 [])
which is O(n) overall.
TL;DR

@ concatenates two lists (duplicates preserved), but costs proportional to the length of the first list.
:: conses a single element in constant time.
Use :: (plus List.rev if you’re accumulating) for building lists element by element, and @ only when you really need to glue two complete lists together.

You said:
Are sets allowed to include duplicates?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
By definition, a set is a collection of distinct elements—duplicates aren’t allowed.

Mathematical sets: if you “add” an element that’s already present, nothing changes; the set remains the same.
OCaml’s Set module: built on balanced trees, it enforces uniqueness. Calling Set.add x s where x is already in s simply returns the original set unchanged.
If you need to track multiple occurrences (a “bag” or multiset), you’ll want a different structure—e.g. a Map from element to count, or a dedicated multiset library.

What is a good way to build an accumulator while going over list recursively in Ocaml
ChatGPT said:
A common pattern is to write a tail‑recursive helper that carries your “so‑far” result as an extra parameter, then (if you built a list) reverse it at the end. Here’s the shape:

(* e.g. transform each elt and collect into a list *)
let map_tailrec f lst =
  let rec aux remaining acc =
    match remaining with
    | []      -> List.rev acc
    | x :: xs -> aux xs (f x :: acc)
  in
  aux lst []
acc is your accumulator.
We cons into acc in O(1) each step.
When remaining is empty, we rev to restore the original order.
Because the recursive call is the very last thing (aux …), this is tail‑recursive and runs in O(n) stack – no risk of blowing the call stack on long lists.
You can apply exactly the same pattern for any sort of accumulator. For example, summing integers:

let sum lst =
  let rec aux remaining acc =
    match remaining with
    | []      -> acc
    | x :: xs -> aux xs (acc + x)
  in
  aux lst 0
Or, if you’d rather not write the boilerplate, the standard library’s List.fold_left already does this:

(* same as sum *)
let sum = List.fold_left ( + ) 0

(* same as map_tailrec, but builds in reverse: *)
let rev_mapped = List.fold_left (fun acc x -> f x :: acc) [] lst
let mapped     = List.rev rev_mapped
TL;DR

Write a helper aux lst acc that in the x::xs case does aux xs (…update acc…).
For building lists, cons onto acc then List.rev acc at the end.
Or just reach for List.fold_left.
You said:
can you explain the List.fold_left function more in depth?
ChatGPT said:
List.fold_left is one of OCaml’s workhorse list combinators—it “reduces” a list to a single value by threading an accumulator through each element, processing elements from left to right in a tail‑recursive, constant‑stack way.

Type and signature

val List.fold_left : ('acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) -> 'acc -> 'elt list -> 'acc
f : a function of type acc -> elt -> acc.
It takes the current accumulator and the next list element, and returns the updated accumulator.
init : the initial value of the accumulator ('acc).
lst : the list of elements ('elt list) you want to reduce.
The result is the final accumulator of type 'acc.

How it works

Conceptually, given

List.fold_left f init [x1; x2; x3; …; xn]
it computes:

a1 = f init x1
a2 = f a1 x2
a3 = f a2 x3
…
an = f a(n-1) xn
returns an
Because each recursive call is in tail position (aux xs new_acc), it uses O(1) stack space, making it safe on long lists.

Simple examples

Summing a list of ints
let sum nums =
  List.fold_left (fun acc x -> acc + x) 0 nums
;;

sum [1;2;3;4]   (* = ((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4 = 10 *)
Building a reversed map
If you want to apply f to every element and collect the results:

let rev_map f lst =
  List.fold_left (fun acc x -> f x :: acc) [] lst
;;

rev_map (fun x -> x * 2) [1; 2; 3]  (* = [6;4;2] *)
If you need the original order, just List.rev the result:

let map f lst =
  List.rev (rev_map f lst)
;;
Comparison with List.fold_right

fold_left processes from the head toward the tail:
(...((init • x1) • x2) • ...) • xn.
fold_right processes from tail to head but isn’t tail‑recursive:
x1 • (x2 • (… (xn • init)…)).
Use fold_left for most reductions on long lists to avoid stack overflows.

When to use

Aggregations (sum, product, length, max/min, boolean tests).
Building up containers (lists, maps, strings, etc.), especially when you can reverse at the end or when order doesn’t matter.
Stateful traversals where you need to carry some context forward.
By choosing an appropriate init and f, you can express almost any left‑to‑right traversal without explicit recursion.

You said:
how would I use it in combination with a function that acts as the accumulator and then on a list of lists
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8 seconds
Here’s the general pattern for “folding” a function over a list of lists without ever writing an explicit rec:

let fold_nested (f : 'acc -> 'elt -> 'acc) (init : 'acc) (lls : 'elt list list) : 'acc =
  List.fold_left
    (fun acc sublist ->
       List.fold_left f acc sublist
    )
    init
    lls
What’s happening?

Outer List.fold_left
Starts with your overall accumulator init : 'acc.
For each sublist : 'elt list in lls, it calls the anonymous function
fun acc sublist -> List.fold_left f acc sublist
passing in the current acc.
Inner List.fold_left f acc sublist
Folds your original f : 'acc -> 'elt -> 'acc across that sublist, starting from acc, and returns a new accumulator which then feeds the next outer iteration.
Example 1: summing a list of int‐lists
let sum_nested (lists : int list list) : int =
  let add acc x = acc + x in
  fold_nested add 0 lists
;;

sum_nested [[1;2;3]; [4;5]; [6]]  (* = 21 *)
Example 2: flattening (and why you might prefer a specialized approach)
You could also flatten first, then fold:

let flatten_then_fold f init lls =
  List.fold_left f init (List.concat lls)
But that builds an intermediate list of all elements, whereas the nested‐fold version above does everything in one pass.

When your accumulator is itself a function
If you have a list of transformations and want to compose them:

let compose_all (fs : ('a -> 'a) list) : 'a -> 'a =
  List.fold_left
    (fun acc f -> fun x -> f (acc x))
    (fun x -> x)   (* identity *)
    fs
;;

let pipeline = compose_all [String.trim; String.uppercase_ascii; String.rev]
in
pipeline "  hello "  (* = "OLLEH" *)
Here the accumulator type is ('a -> 'a), init is the identity function, and each step builds a new composed function.

TL;DR

For a list of lists, nest two List.fold_left calls: outer to pick each sublist, inner to fold your original f across that sublist.
This runs in O(total # elements) time, uses only O(1) stack (tail‐recursive), and never allocates a big intermediate list.

What is Russel's Paradox in simple terms
ChatGPT said:
At its heart, Russell’s Paradox shows that “naively” defining a set by any property you like can lead to a contradiction.

The setup: In naive set theory, you assume that for any condition P(x) you can form the set
S = { x | P(x) }  
Russell’s clever choice: Let
R = { S | S is a set and S ∉ S }  
i.e. “the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.”
The contradiction:
If R ∈ R, then by definition R must not contain itself – so R ∉ R.
If R ∉ R, then it satisfies the defining condition of R, so R ∈ R.
In either case you flip back and forth, and you can’t consistently say whether R is in R or not.
A “barber” version
Imagine a village where the barber shaves exactly those—and only those—villagers who do not shave themselves.

Does the barber shave himself?
If he does, then by rule he must not shave himself.
If he doesn’t, then by rule he must shave himself.
Again, a clear contradiction.
Why it matters
Russell’s Paradox showed that you can’t allow every “property” to define a set. It spurred the development of modern axiomatic set theories (like Zermelo–Fraenkel) that restrict which sets you’re allowed to form, avoiding this kind of self‐referential loop.

You said:
Does Ocaml allow for the use of references and how could I enable a recursive check or cyclic structure to allow for a check of a reference to a list within a list
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 27 seconds
Yes — OCaml is impure enough to give you mutable references and even cyclic data‑structures, but the built‑in singly‑linked ’a list is itself immutable, so you can’t “splice” into its tail once it’s built. Here are the main techniques:

1. References (ref) and mutable fields

(* A simple mutable cell holding an 'int list' *)
let r : int list ref = ref [1;2;3]

(* Read it: *)
!r     (* ⇒ [1;2;3] *)

(* Update it: *)
r := 4 :: !r   (* now !r = [4;1;2;3] *)
You can store those refs inside lists (int list ref list) or in record fields:

type ’a node = {
  value : ’a;
  mutable children : ’a node list;
}

let rec make_cycle () =
  (* placeholder nodes *)
  let rec a = { value = "A"; children = [b] }
  and     b = { value = "B"; children = [a] }
  in
  a
Here a.children points to b and b.children back to a—a two‑node cycle.

2. Knot‑tying with let rec

Even without ref, you can create a self‑referential list:

let rec ones = 1 :: ones
(* ones = <cycle> internally *)
ones is a cyclic list of infinite 1s. OCaml happily allocates it because let rec lets the tail pointer refer to the list being defined.

3. Checking for a particular sublist (physical reference)

If you want to ask “does this exact list (or node) occur inside my structure?”, you need physical equality. Use:

== for pointer‑equality
or the specialized List.memq which is just mem with == under the hood:
# List.memq ones [ones; [2;3]] ;;
- : bool = true
For a two‑level nested list (’a list list), you could write:

let contains_sublist target lls =
  List.memq target lls
For deeper or arbitrary nesting, recurse but guard against infinite loops (cycles!) by tracking visited nodes:

let contains_sublist_deep target root =
  let visited = Hashtbl.create 16 in
  let rec aux lsts =
    List.exists
      (fun sub ->
         if sub == target then true
         else if Hashtbl.mem visited sub then false
         else (
           Hashtbl.add visited sub ();
           aux sub
         )
      )
      lsts
  in
  aux root
Here we assume root : ’a list list and sub : ’a list. We compare sub == target so it only returns true if they’re the exact same cons‐cell pointer.

4. A tail‑recursive “fold” over a list of lists

If you just want to accumulate a result over a ’a list list (without caring about cycles), combine two folds:

let fold_nested f init lls =
  List.fold_left
    (fun acc sublist -> List.fold_left f acc sublist)
    init
    lls
TL;DR
Yes: use ref or mutable record fields for pointers you can update.
You can also use let rec … to tie the knot in a pure list.
Detecting “this same list” means physical equality (== or List.memq).
Guard against infinite recursion in cyclic graphs by tracking visited nodes in a Hashtbl.
You said:
Can pure Ocaml have an infinite type and is their a form of pointer that would allow for me to check if a set contained itself 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10 seconds
OCaml’s type system is strictly finite (unless you turn on the unsupported -rectypes flag), so you cannot declare an “infinite” type in the sense of a type that literally unfolds forever at compile time. However, you can build infinite values (e.g. a cyclic or lazy data structure) at runtime, and you can use runtime pointers (references) and physical‐equality tests to detect cycles or even have a container refer to itself.

1. Infinite types vs. infinite values

Infinite types
OCaml does not allow a type equation like:
type t = t   (* would unfold infinitely! *)
You’ll get an “infinite type” error if you try. OCaml only supports regular recursive types (e.g. variant or record types that mention themselves in a well‑founded way).
Infinite values
You can write pure OCaml that builds a cyclic structure at runtime:
let rec ones = 1 :: ones
Here ones is an infinite list of 1’s. The type is just int list, but the value is cyclic.
2. Making a data structure that can contain itself

Because the built‑in ’a list is immutable, you can’t splice an existing list into itself after the fact. But you can introduce an explicit pointer cell (ref) or a mutable field in a record:

type 'a node = {
  value    : 'a;
  mutable next : 'a node list;
}

(* Create two nodes that point at each other: *)
let make_cycle x y =
  let rec a = { value = x; next = [b] }
  and     b = { value = y; next = [a] }
  in
  a
Now a.next contains b and b.next contains a. You’ve got a genuine 2‑node cycle.

3. Checking “does this container contain itself?”

Physical equality (==)
OCaml gives you pointer (identity) equality:

# let r = ref 0;;
val r : int ref = {contents = 0}
# r == r;;
- : bool = true
Only the same ref cell satisfies ==. Structural equality (=) would compare contents.

Putting refs in a Set
If you really want a Set that can contain its own pointer, you can:

Define an ordering on refs by their unique object IDs:
module R = struct
  type t = int ref
  let compare a b = Stdlib.compare (Oo.id a) (Oo.id b)
end
module RefSet = Set.Make(R)
Build and self‑insert:
let s = ref RefSet.empty in
s := RefSet.add s !s;      (* now !s contains the pointer s itself *)
RefSet.mem s !s             (* => true *)
Because you compare s by its identity (Oo.id s), the set can legally contain the very reference cell that is the set.

TL;DR
Infinite types are disallowed in OCaml’s type system (without the -rectypes hack).
Infinite or cyclic values are perfectly fine: use let rec on a value, or mutable fields/refs.
To let a container hold itself and detect that, store a pointer (ref or a mutable record) in the container and use physical equality (==) or a custom Set over Oo.id to check “am I in myself?”
You said:
does this create side effects?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Whenever you introduce and update a ref or a mutable field, you’re stepping out of “pure” OCaml and into side‑effects:

Pure cyclic values
let rec ones = 1 :: ones
This builds an infinite (cyclic) list without any side‑effects—no mutation, no hidden state.
Mutable references
let s = ref RefSet.empty
s := RefSet.add s !s    (* ← this is a side‑effect! *)
Here, s := … writes into the cell s, which is a side‑effect. Every time you do := or update a mutable record field, you’re altering program state.
Physical equality checks (==, List.memq) themselves are pure (they don’t mutate anything), but they only make sense if you have some mutable or self‑referential structure to observe.
TL;DR

Building a cycle purely with let rec is side‑effect free.
Using ref (and doing s := …) or mutable record fields is impure and does create side‑effects.
You said:
how do I make a function recursive in Ocaml
ChatGPT said:
In OCaml you make a function recursive simply by using let rec instead of let. That rec keyword tells the compiler “this function’s body may mention its own name.”

(* non‑recursive: this won’t compile if you try to call fact inside *)
let fact_bad n =
  if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact_bad (n-1)
(* Error: Unbound value fact_bad *)

(* recursive: OK to refer to fact here *)
let rec fact n =
  if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n-1)
;;

fact 5  (* = 120 *)
Key points
let rec
Always use rec when the function’s definition refers to itself.
Omitting rec makes the name unavailable inside its own body.
Mutually recursive functions
If two (or more) functions call each other, use and:
let rec is_even n =
  if n = 0 then true else is_odd (n-1)
and     is_odd  n =
  if n = 0 then false else is_even (n-1)
;;
Tail‑recursive style
A plain recursive function like the above can overflow the stack on large inputs. To make it tail‑recursive, add an accumulator parameter:
let rec fact_tr n acc =
  if n = 0 then acc
  else fact_tr (n-1) (acc * n)
;;
let fact n = fact_tr n 1
Syntax summary
let rec f arg1 arg2 … =
  (* body, may call f (…) *)
That’s all you need—replace let with let rec, and OCaml allows the function to invoke itself.

You said:
Does a function in Ocaml have to be defined before it is called or can the function be declared afterwards
ChatGPT said:
In OCaml’s toplevel (and in a .ml file), definitions are processed in the order you write them. You cannot call a function before it’s been defined, unless you:

Group mutually‑recursive functions in one block with let rec … and …, for example:
let rec even n =
  if n = 0 then true else odd (n-1)
and odd n =
  if n = 0 then false else even (n-1)
Use a separate interface file (.mli) to declare signatures, but at compile time the .ml still needs to define them in order (the compiler checks against the .mli).
Key rules
Single recursive:
let rec f x = … f …   (* OK, f is in scope throughout its own body *)
Mutual recursion:
let rec a x = … b …  
and     b y = … a …  
No forward declarations:
let foo x = bar x    (* ❌ Error: Unbound value bar *)
let bar y = y + 1
You must swap them, or group them in a let rec … and.
TL;DR: OCaml does not allow you to define a function “below” its first use—instead, either define it first or group mutually‑recursive definitions with let rec … and ….

does putting a raw value x and then :: appending a list afterwards create a list with x and then the tail as the result of the recursive function call
ChatGPT said:
Exactly—(::) is the cons operator of type

(::) : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list
So when you write

x :: (foo xs)
you’re constructing a new list whose head is x and whose tail is whatever list foo xs returns. In a recursive function, that typically looks like:

let rec map f = function
  | []      -> []
  | x :: xs -> (f x) :: map f xs
Here:

On each call, you take the raw value f x.
You cons it onto the front of the list produced by map f xs.
The result is a list with head (f x) and tail map f xs.
That’s exactly how you build up the result list element by element.

how do I create types that are tied to Terminal T and Non terminal representations
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7 seconds
You can capture “terminals vs. non‐terminals” in your AST by giving yourself a little sum‐type for symbols, and then building your rules and grammar around it. A common pattern is:

(* 1) the symbol type, parameterized so you can plug in
     whatever terminal/nonterminal types you like: *)
type ('nonterm, 'term) symbol =
  | N of 'nonterm        (* a non‑terminal symbol *)
  | T of 'term           (* a terminal symbol *)

(* 2) a production rule: a non‑terminal on the left
     and a list of symbols on the right *)
type ('nonterm, 'term) rule = {
  lhs : 'nonterm;
  rhs : ('nonterm, 'term) symbol list;
}

(* 3) a grammar: a designated start non‑terminal
     plus a list of all your rules *)
type ('nonterm, 'term) grammar = {
  start : 'nonterm;
  rules : ('nonterm, 'term) rule list;
}
Why this “ties” them together
symbol is a single type 'a symbol whose constructors are N and T.
Whenever you pattern‐match on a symbol you know exactly where your terminals live and where your nonterminals live:
let is_generating (g : 'nonterm list) (r : ('nonterm, 'term) symbol list) =
  List.for_all (function
    | T _ -> true           (* a terminal is always “okay” *)
    | N nt -> List.mem nt g (* only those nonterminals in g *)
  ) r
Your grammar and rule types both refer back to the same 'nonterm and 'term parameters, so they’re all guaranteed to speak the same “language.”
Concrete example
If you have

type nt = S | A | B
type t  = Plus | Times | Int of int
then

let my_grammar : (nt, t) grammar = {
  start = S;
  rules = [
    { lhs = S; rhs = [N A; T Plus; N B] };
    { lhs = A; rhs = [T (Int 1)] };
    { lhs = B; rhs = [T (Int 2)] };

}
Here each N A, N B is a non‑terminal symbol, each T Plus or T (Int 2) is a terminal.

Alternatives
GADT approach if you want the type checker to know “this is a terminal symbol” vs. “nonterminal” at the type level.
Phantom types to distinguish contexts where only terminals or only nonterminals can appear.
But 99% of the time the simple polymorphic‐variant above is all you need.

Can you help me understand what a blind_alley is in the context of a a grammar and how it relates to cyclic and acyclic graphs of grammars and terminal and non terminal types
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5 seconds
In the world of formal grammars, a blind alley (sometimes called a non‑generating symbol or non‑terminating nonterminal) is simply a nonterminal that can’t ever produce a string made up entirely of terminals. Every rule whose left‑hand side (LHS) is a blind alley—and every rule that depends on it—is “dead code” in the grammar’s language.

1. Terminals vs. nonterminals

Terminals (T) are the “alphabet” of symbols your language actually emits (e.g. characters, tokens).
Nonterminals (N) are placeholders used in production rules to build up structure, but they don’t appear in the final output.
A rule looks like

lhs : nonterminal
rhs : symbol list   (* each symbol is either N of nonterminal or T of terminal *)
2. The grammar as a graph

You can view the grammar’s nonterminals as nodes in a directed graph:

Nodes = nonterminals
Edges = if there’s a rule A → … N B …, draw an edge A → B.
Additionally, any rule whose RHS contains only terminals (no N …) marks its LHS as initially generating.

Acyclic graph: no cycles among nonterminals. Every path eventually bottoms out in a terminal‑only rule or dead end.
Cyclic graph: you can loop (e.g. A → B …, B → A …). Cycles aren’t automatically bad—if the cycle has at least one terminal‑anchored rule you can still generate strings. But a cycle with no terminal‑anchored rule (e.g. A → B, B → A) is entirely blind.
3. Blind alleys = non‑generating nonterminals

Start with the set G₀ of all nonterminals that have at least one rule whose RHS is all terminals.
Iterate: if a rule LHS → … has every nonterminal in its RHS already in Gᵢ, then add LHS to Gᵢ₊₁.
Fixed point: when no new nonterminals get added, you’ve found G, the generating set.
Anything outside G is a blind alley. Those nonterminals (and their rules) can never reach a terminal string.

let rec compute_creating_set rules =
  let new_set s = List.fold_left update_rules s rules in
  computed_fixed_point equal_sets new_set []
let filter_blind_alleys (start, rules) =
  let gen = compute_creating_set rules in
  let good r = List.mem r.lhs gen && is_right_side_creating r.rhs gen in
  (start, List.filter good rules)
update_rules adds a rule’s LHS when its RHS is “all in” the current generating set.
filter_blind_alleys drops every rule whose LHS isn’t generating or whose RHS still mentions a non‑generating symbol.
Why it matters
Cleaner grammars. Eliminates unreachable/dead nonterminals and rules.
Better parsing. Parsers don’t need to consider rules that can never produce valid input.
Cycle handling. Detects purely cyclic dead‑ends (e.g. A ↔ B with no terminals) and prunes them away.
In short, a blind alley is a nonterminal (or rule) that lives in a part of your grammar-graph that has no path to any purely‑terminal production—acyclic or cyclic—and so contributes nothing to the language you’re trying to define.

what does .tl do 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19 seconds
In OCaml the “.” symbol is overloaded for two things:

Module lookup
Whenever you write
List.tl
you’re saying “in the module List, get me the value tl.” And indeed,

val List.tl : 'a list -> 'a list
is the standard library function that returns the tail of a list (everything but its first element), raising Failure "tl" on [].
Record‐field access
If you define your own record type with a field named tl, then
type 'a node = { hd : 'a; tl : 'a node list }
let x = { hd = 1; tl = [] }
let tail = x.tl       (* <-- record‑field projection “.tl” *)
here x.tl simply pulls out the tl field from record x. There’s nothing magical about it—it’s pure and constant‐time.
Getting the tail of a built‑in list
If you meant the usual singly‑linked list, don’t write my_list.tl (that won’t compile). Instead either

Call the library function
let xs = List.tl my_list
which raises Failure "tl" on [], or
Pattern‑match (the safest, most idiomatic way):
match my_list with
| []      -> (* handle empty case *)
| _ :: xs -> xs
TL;DR

.tl by itself isn’t a built‑in operator—you either have to be in a module (List.tl) or have defined a record with a tl field (record_var.tl).
To get the tail of a standard list use List.tl list or pattern matching.

Below is how you can think about these tests in terms of the usual “blind‑alley” (a.k.a. non‑generating) algorithm:

Compute the generating set G of nonterminals that can eventually produce a string of only terminals.
Prune all rules whose left‑hand side isn’t in G, or whose right‑hand side mentions a nonterminal not in G.
–––

1. Your awksub grammar and its graph

type awksub_nonterminals =
  | Expr | Lvalue | Incrop | Binop | Num

let awksub_rules =
  [ Expr, [T"(";  N Expr;        T")"]           (* paren *)
  ; Expr, [N Num]                              (* num literal *)
  ; Expr, [N Expr; N Binop; N Expr]           (* binary op *)
  ; Expr, [N Lvalue]                          (* variable access *)
  ; Expr, [N Incrop; N Lvalue]                (* ++x *)
  ; Expr, [N Lvalue; N Incrop]                (* x++ *)
  ; Lvalue, [T"$"; N Expr]                    (* $x *)
  ; Incrop, [T"++"]
  ; Incrop, [T"--"]
  ; Binop, [T"+"]
  ; Binop, [T"-"]
  ; Num,   [T"0"]  (* … through T"9" *) ]
  
let awksub_grammar = Expr, awksub_rules
If you draw the graph nodes = {Expr,Lvalue,Incrop,Binop,Num}
and edges A → B whenever there’s a rule A → … N B …, you get something like:

     Expr ──► Num
      │
      ├─► Binop
      │
      ├─► Lvalue ◄──────┐
      │                  │
      └─► Incrop ────────┘
Plus the self‑edge Expr → Expr in the binary‑op rule.

Notice that Incrop, Binop, and Num each have at least one rule of the form

Incrop → [T"++"]      (* no nonterminals at all! *)
Binop  → [T"+"] 
Num    → [T"0"] …[T"9"]
so they are immediately generating.

test0
filter_blind_alleys awksub_grammar = awksub_grammar
G₀ = {Incrop, Binop, Num}
Next you see that
Expr → [N Num] ⇒ Num ∈ G₀ ⇒ add Expr
Lvalue → [T"$"; N Expr] ⇒ Expr now in G₁ ⇒ add Lvalue
No other nonterminals remain.
G = {Incrop, Binop, Num, Expr, Lvalue} = “all of them,” so nothing is pruned.
test1
filter_blind_alleys (Expr, List.tl awksub_rules) = (Expr, List.tl awksub_rules)
Here List.tl awksub_rules simply drops the very first rule (Expr → "(" Expr ")"). But that rule wasn’t needed for generation, because Expr → [N Num] already ties Expr back to the terminal‑only Num rules.

When you recompute G exactly the same way, you still end up with all five nonterminals. Hence pruning does nothing.

test2
let bad_rules =
  [ Expr, [N Num]
  ; Expr, [N Lvalue]
  ; Expr, [N Expr; N Lvalue]
  ; Expr, [N Lvalue; N Expr]
  ; Expr, [N Expr; N Binop; N Expr]
  ; Lvalue, [N Lvalue; N Expr]
  ; Lvalue, [N Expr; N Lvalue]
  ; Lvalue, [N Incrop; N Lvalue]
  ; Lvalue, [N Lvalue; N Incrop]
  ; Incrop, [T"++"]; Incrop, [T"--"]
  ; Binop,  [T"+" ]; Binop,  [T"-" ]
  ; Num,    [T"0"]; …;      [T"9"] ]

filter_blind_alleys (Expr, bad_rules)
= ( Expr,
    [ Expr, [N Num]
    ; Expr, [N Expr; N Binop; N Expr]
    ; Incrop, [T"++"]; Incrop, [T"--"]
    ; Binop,  [T"+" ]; Binop,  [T"-" ]
    ; Num,    [T"0"]; …;      [T"9"] ] )
What happened

G₀ = {Incrop,Binop,Num} (same as before)
Rule Expr → [N Num] ⇒ add Expr ⇒ G₁ = {…, Expr}
Lvalue never enters G, because every Lvalue rule mentions Lvalue itself in the RHS (so it’s a little cycle Lvalue → Lvalue …), and there is no purely‑terminal Lvalue rule.
Final G = {Incrop, Binop, Num, Expr}.
When you prune:

You keep only rules whose LHS ∈ G.
And whose RHS’s nonterminals are all in G.
That:

Drops every Lvalue rule (Lvalue ∉ G).
Drops any Expr rule whose RHS still mentions Lvalue (so you lose the Expr → [N Lvalue] and the two mixed ones).
Keeps the “binary‑op” rule (Expr → [N Expr; N Binop; N Expr]) because now Expr ∈ G and Binop ∈ G.
test3
filter_blind_alleys (Expr, drop3)  =
filter_blind_alleys (Expr, drop2)
drop2 removes the first two rules (paren and Expr→[N Num]), but still has the binary‑op rule.
drop3 also loses the binary‑op rule, so you’re left with only cycles Expr ⇄ Lvalue and the pure terminals.
In both cases you end up with

G = {Incrop,Binop,Num}
—because with no Expr → [N Num], there’s no way to bootstrap Expr into G. Thus both drop2 and drop3 grammars collapse to just the terminal‑only rules when pruned, and so their filter_blind_alleys results coincide.

Putting it all together

A blind alley is a nonterminal (and all rules defining it) that can never reach a purely‑terminal RHS.
You detect them by computing the generating set G in rounds, starting from those nonterminals with at least one all‑terminal production.
Cycles in the grammar graph are only kept if somewhere in that cycle there is a terminal‑anchored rule. Otherwise the entire cycle is “blind” and gets thrown away.
These four tests simply exercise that logic:

test0: no blind alleys in the full grammar.
test1: dropping an unneeded rule still leaves a fully‐generating grammar.
test2: you create a little blind‑cycle between Expr↔Lvalue (because you removed Expr→Num and the Lvalue→terminal rule), so only Expr and the pure terminals remain.
test3: whether you drop one more cycle rule or two, the end pruned grammar is the same—a proof that once you’ve “lost” the bootstrap rule, nothing else can save Expr.
